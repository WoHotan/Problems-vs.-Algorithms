  Split a path based on "/" as a list. Similar to autocomplete Trie, the list element represent the char of word. And then use RouteTrie implement Router. The time complexity of RouteTrie find and insert function is O(n), which n is the length of path_list. The space complexity of Router is O(n), which n is the length of path list.
