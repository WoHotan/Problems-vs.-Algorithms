  Sort the array using the quicksort algorithm, the time complexity is O(nlog(n)), which n is the length of array.
  After sorted, the first number is composed of elements whose subscript is even, and the second number is composed of elements whose subscript is odd. The time complexity is O(n).

  So, the time complexity of this algorithm is O(nlog(n)), and the space complexity is O(1).
